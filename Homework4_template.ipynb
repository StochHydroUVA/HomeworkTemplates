That is, generate 250, 550 and 1050 years of log-space annual maxima from this distribution, but assume you can only observe synthetically generated floods from the historical record that are above a threshold equal to the known log-space 100-yr flood (the 99th percentile of the P3 distribution with the aforementioned known parameters), while you can observe all 50 of the annual maxima in the systematic record.\n","\n","### (a) For each synthetic time series, use EMA and AMA to estimate the log-space 100-yr flood.
